	It happened in Hong Kong in 2013. A child named Qiu Zhi downloaded a beta version of "mojang AB" minecraft launcher on the Internet. And downloaded the latest minecraft version 1.3.3 at that time. Just entering the game, the game was filled with a strange atmosphere and a lot of wrong rendering. Qiu Zhi quit the game after playing for a period of time, and the game destroyed itself at the moment of exit.<br/>
	Five days later, Qiu Zhi turned on the computer again. In the launcher, minecraft 1.3.3 had disappeared, and a program called minecraft 1.3.? Exe appeared on the desktop. He thought it was a computer virus, so he deleted it. Until 2017, he saw this program again. It was just on the dark Internet. He couldn't help being curious and downloaded minecraft 1.3.? Exe. And ran it. The familiar game appeared in front of him again, which was almost no different from 1.3.3, but the atmosphere was more strange. The official version of minecraft had been updated to 1.11.2. Compared with the new version, this mysterious old version could attract him more.<br/>
	The next day, Qiu Zhi disappeared. The family were very worried. Before he left, he took a lot of money from home, about 20000 Hong Kong dollars (about 2500 US dollars). The family called the police. After investigation, Qiu Zhi spent all his money after buying a lot of bitcoins, and then jumped out of a building to commit suicide. However, his body was not recruited, only a lot of blood was seen. After identification, the blood came from Qiu Zhi.<br/>
	In May 2017, the malicious software wannacry broke out in Ukraine, Russia, India, Spain, France, the United Kingdom and many European countries, and many Chinese families and enterprises were also attacked by malicious software. On a malware sample research forum, a user named crazy Zimin fans released a "minecraft ransomware '", which has an interface similar to wannacry, but the content is a joke program about minecraft. The next reply in this post attracted the attention of the administrator<br/>
	"Qiu Zhi: I have seen a similar virus about minecraft, which is also blackmail bitcoin"<br/>
	The missing child appeared in the forum again. The administrator immediately contacted him and confirmed that he was Qiu Zhi himself. Sent him back to his home<br/>
	In November 2020, minecraft 1.16.4 was released, and minecraft 1.3.? Exe appeared again on some pirated game resource websites<br/>
